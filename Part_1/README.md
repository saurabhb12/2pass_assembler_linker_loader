NOTE: We will compile and execute only file pass2.cpp as in its code, both Pass1 and Pass2 are being performed

Compilation of code:
g++ pass2.cpp

Running the code:
./a.out

The file INPUT.txt is the input to the assembler.
After completion of pass1 and pass2 the following files are generated:
intermediate_INPUT.txt  ----> Intermediate file
listing_INPUT.txt -----> Listing file
error_INPUT.txt ----> Error Handling FIle
object_INPUT.txt ----> Final output object code of assembler along with modification records.
